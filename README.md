# learn_equations_of_motion
Can you automate a pipeline from particle-level simulations to course-grained governing equations? 

First, a gpu-accelerated simulation is performed with [hoomd-blue](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/).
The output of the simulation is then processed and fed into the methods layed out in [this interesting paper](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602614).
